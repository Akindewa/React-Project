##  Overview

- Add Tasks: Allows users to input new tasks through a text input field and add them to the list.

- Display Tasks: Dynamically displays the list of tasks that the user has added.

- Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed using checkboxes or buttons, often resulting in a visual  change (e.g., strikethrough or faded text).

- Edit Tasks: Allows users to edit existing tasks, typically through an edit button that changes the task to an    editable    input field.

- Delete Tasks: Enables users to remove tasks from the list by clicking a delete button.

- Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks by status, such as All, Active, and Completed tasks.

- Task Count: Displays the number of active or incomplete tasks.

- Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for better user experience on mobile and desktop.

- Persistent Storage: Optionally, uses localStorage or an external database to save tasks so they persist even after a page refresh.
